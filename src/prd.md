# SupplySync ERP - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: SupplySync ERP is a centralized enterprise platform that ensures operational continuity through predictive supply replenishment while enforcing governance and achieving the lowest landed cost for all non-merchandise supplies across a multi-location retail network.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Zero operational surprises (stockouts of critical supplies)
- Measurable cost savings through deterministic vendor selection
- 100% audit compliance with immutable approval trails
- Reduced procurement cycle times through automated workflows

**Experience Qualities**: Professional, Trustworthy, Efficient

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, role-based access, multi-user workflows)

**Primary User Activity**: Acting (approval workflows, order processing, supply management)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Fragmented, ad-hoc ordering processes across retail locations lead to operational disruptions, cost inefficiencies, and compliance gaps.

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke confidence, efficiency, and professional competence. Users should feel that the system is reliable and trustworthy.

**Design Personality**: Professional and systematic, with subtle modern touches. The interface should feel authoritative yet approachable.

**Visual Metaphors**: Clean forms and structured layouts that reflect the organized nature of supply chain management. Clear hierarchies that mirror organizational structure.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced interface - rich enough to handle complex workflows but clean enough to prevent cognitive overload.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Complementary with neutral base

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - communicates trust, stability, and corporate professionalism

**Secondary Colors**: Clean grays and whites for backgrounds, providing neutral foundation

**Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - for calls-to-action and important highlights, suggesting efficiency and forward motion

**Color Psychology**: Blue establishes authority and trust essential for enterprise systems. Amber accents provide warmth and urgency without being alarming.

**Color Accessibility**: All combinations meet WCAG AA standards with minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratios.

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary text on background: Dark gray (oklch(0.15 0 0)) on white (oklch(1 0 0)) - 15.0:1 contrast
- Primary button text: White (oklch(1 0 0)) on blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - 8.2:1 contrast
- Card text: Dark gray (oklch(0.15 0 0)) on light gray (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - 14.7:1 contrast
- Accent text: White (oklch(1 0 0)) on amber (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - 5.1:1 contrast

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy

**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headlines: 24-32px, weight 700
- Subheadings: 18-20px, weight 600  
- Body text: 14-16px, weight 400
- Captions: 12-13px, weight 400

**Font Personality**: Clean, professional, highly legible in data-heavy interfaces

**Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, optimal 45-75 characters per line

**Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing scale (8px base) for vertical rhythm

**Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) for all text elements

**Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent legibility at small sizes, crucial for data tables and compact interfaces

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Status badges and action buttons use color strategically to guide attention to critical decisions

**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load in complex data interfaces

**Grid System**: 8px base grid with 24px containers for consistent alignment

**Responsive Approach**: Desktop-first with card-based layouts that stack on mobile

**Content Density**: Balanced approach - dense enough for efficiency, spaced enough for clarity

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions reinforce state changes and system feedback

**Hierarchy of Movement**: Status changes get priority, followed by navigation transitions

**Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, professional animations appropriate for enterprise environment

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for order summaries and product listings
- Tables for detailed data views
- Dialogs for approval workflows and order details
- Badges for status indicators and role labels

**Component Customization**: Status badges with semantic colors, buttons with clear action hierarchy

**Component States**: Clear hover, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements

**Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for consistent visual language - outline style for navigation, filled for active states

**Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (blue), secondary actions (gray outline), destructive actions (red)

**Spacing System**: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px scale for consistent component spacing

**Mobile Adaptation**: Cards stack vertically, tables become scrollable, dialog sizes adjust

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based design with shadcn/ui as foundation

**Style Guide Elements**: Color tokens, typography scale, spacing system, component variants

**Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card heights, aligned baselines, predictable interaction patterns

**Brand Alignment**: Professional, trustworthy, efficient - reflected in color choices and typography

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1) as minimum standard, with many elements exceeding this to AAA level (7:1)

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
**Potential Obstacles**: Network connectivity issues during order submission, unclear approval requirements, delayed vendor responses

**Edge Case Handling**: 
- Offline form persistence using local storage
- Clear visual indicators for approval requirements
- Timeout handling with graceful error messages

**Technical Constraints**: Browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, data synchronization

## Implementation Considerations
**Scalability Needs**: Designed for thousands of users across hundreds of locations

**Testing Focus**: Approval workflow integrity, role-based access control, order state management

**Critical Questions**: How to handle conflicting vendor selections? What happens during system maintenance?

## Reflection
This approach uniquely addresses enterprise supply chain management by combining automated intelligence with human oversight. The role-based workflow ensures governance while the modern interface reduces training requirements. The success depends on balancing automation with control, ensuring users feel empowered rather than constrained by the system.
