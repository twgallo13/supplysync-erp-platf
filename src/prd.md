# SupplySync ERP - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: SupplySync ERP is a mobile-first enterprise platform that centralizes non-merchandise supply management across multi-location retail networks, ensuring operational continuity through predictive automation and strict governance.

**Success Indicators**:

- Zero stockouts of mission-critical supplies
- <200ms API response times for warehouse operations
- 95%+ mobile user satisfaction for floor operations
- Complete audit trail for all transactions

**Experience Qualities**: Fast, Reliable, Auditable

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, role-based access, real-time operations)

**Primary User Activity**: Acting (approving orders, scanning items, processing receipts)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Fragmented supply chain processes cause stockouts and inefficient procurement across retail locations.

**User Context**: Store managers need quick ordering, warehouse staff need efficient receiving, facility managers need oversight - all on mobile devices in operational environments.

**Key Moments**:

1. Successful barcode scan with haptic confirmation
2. Order approval with immediate status update
3. Emergency stockout alert with priority escalation

### Mobile-First Operations

- **Functionality**: Touch-optimized interface with 44px+ touch targets, gesture support
- **Purpose**: Enable warehouse and store floor operations on mobile devices

### Barcode Scanning & Receiving

- **Functionality**: Camera-based scanning with haptic feedback, batch processing, exception handling
- **Purpose**: Streamline receiving operations and inventory management

### Role-Based Workflows

- **Functionality**: SM ordering, DM approvals, FM fulfillment - each with mobile-optimized interfaces
- **Purpose**: Maintain governance while enabling mobile operations
- **Success Criteria**: Zero unauthorized access, clear role-based navigation

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity

**Emotional Response**: The interface should feel fast, reliable, and professional - instilling confidence in critical supply operations.

**Design Personality**: Clean and utilitarian with subtle enterprise polish. Serious but approachable.

**Visual Metaphors**: Clean lines suggesting efficiency, subtle depth for touch affordance, status indicators using familiar traffic light colors.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes function over decoration.

### Color Strategy

**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with strategic accent colors

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (#2563eb) - conveys trust and reliability for enterprise operations
**Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for backgrounds and supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Amber (#f59e0b) for alerts and call-to-action elements
**Success Color**: Green (#10b981) for confirmations and positive states
**Error Color**: Red (#ef4444) for errors and critical alerts

**Color Psychology**: Blues inspire trust in enterprise contexts, amber draws attention without alarm, green provides clear positive feedback.

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:

- Primary text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) on background (oklch(1 0 0)) - 13.5:1 contrast
- White text on primary blue - 4.7:1 contrast  
- Dark text on amber accent - 5.2:1 contrast
- All pairings exceed WCAG AA requirements

### Typography System

**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with strategic weight variations
**Typographic Hierarchy**:

- Headers: 600 weight, 1.2x line height
- Body: 400 weight, 1.5x line height  
- UI Labels: 500 weight, 1.4x line height

**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism and exceptional mobile legibility
**Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) for complete interface
**Legibility Check**: Inter tested for warehouse lighting conditions and small mobile screens

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

**Attention Direction**: Primary actions use color and size to guide attention, secondary actions use subtle styling
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing (16-24px) to prevent mis-taps and improve scannability
**Grid System**: 4px base unit grid system for consistent spacing and alignment
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement for tablets
**Content Density**: Optimized for single-handed mobile use with critical information above the fold

### Animations & Micro-interactions

**Purposeful Meaning**: Haptic feedback paired with visual animations confirm actions and guide workflow
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical confirmations get both haptic and visual feedback, secondary actions get subtle visual cues
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional animations that enhance rather than distract from operations

### UI Elements & Component Selection

**Component Usage**:

- Cards for order summaries and product details
- Buttons with generous touch targets (44px minimum)
- Form inputs with clear focus states
- Modal dialogs for confirmations requiring reason codes
- Toast notifications paired with haptic feedback

**Mobile Adaptation**: All components stack vertically on mobile, with simplified navigation patterns
**Haptic Integration**: Strategic haptic feedback on scans, approvals, errors, and completions

### Accessibility & Readability

**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum, targeting AAA where possible
**Touch Targets**: All interactive elements 44px minimum
**Screen Reader**: Full semantic markup with ARIA labels
**Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard support for desktop users

## Implementation Considerations

**Mobile Performance**: Aggressive caching, lazy loading, optimized images
**Offline Capabilities**: Core scanning and basic operations work offline
**Enterprise Integration**: SSO/OIDC integration with haptic confirmation of login success
**Haptic Strategy**: Native vibration API with different patterns for different action types

## Reflection

This mobile-first approach uniquely addresses the reality that supply chain operations happen on the warehouse and store floor. The combination of enterprise-grade security with consumer-grade mobile UX, enhanced by strategic haptic feedback, creates an interface that works in real operational environments while maintaining strict governance and audit requirements.
