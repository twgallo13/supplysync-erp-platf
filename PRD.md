# SupplySync ERP - Product Requirements Document

SupplySync ERP is a centralized enterprise platform for managing non-merchandise supplies across a multi-location retail network with predictive analytics, automated replenishment, and role-based approval workflows.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, enterprise-grade interface that instills confidence in mission-critical supply management
2. **Efficient** - Streamlined workflows that minimize clicks and cognitive load for busy store managers and district leaders  
3. **Transparent** - Clear visibility into order status, approval chains, and decision rationale at every step

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- Multi-role authentication system with distinct permission levels and approval workflows
- Real-time order tracking with sophisticated state management across multiple approval stages
- Advanced catalog search with filtering, restrictions, and dynamic pricing from multiple vendors

## Essential Features

**Role-Based Dashboard**
- Functionality: Personalized interface showing relevant orders, approvals, and actions based on user role (SM/DM/FM)
- Purpose: Reduces cognitive load by showing only relevant information and available actions
- Trigger: User login via SSO authentication
- Progression: Login → Role detection → Dashboard personalization → Action routing
- Success criteria: Each role sees only their permitted data and actions within 2 seconds of login

**Supply Catalog & Ordering**
- Functionality: Searchable product catalog with filtering, restricted item flagging, and cart-based ordering
- Purpose: Enables efficient product discovery and ordering while enforcing approval requirements
- Trigger: Store Manager needs to order supplies
- Progression: Search/Browse → Add to cart → Review restrictions → Submit → Approval queue
- Success criteria: Orders submitted successfully with proper routing to approval workflows

**Multi-Stage Approval Workflow**
- Functionality: Automated routing of orders through SM → DM → FM approval chain with reason codes
- Purpose: Ensures proper governance and cost control while maintaining operational efficiency
- Trigger: Order submission or approval/rejection action
- Progression: Submit → DM Queue → DM Decision → FM Queue → FM Decision → Fulfillment
- Success criteria: All state transitions logged with audit trail and proper notifications

**Order Status Tracking**
- Functionality: Real-time visibility into order lifecycle from submission to delivery
- Purpose: Provides transparency and enables proactive issue resolution
- Trigger: User wants to check order status
- Progression: Order History → Select Order → View Status → Track Shipments
- Success criteria: Current status and next steps clearly visible with tracking numbers when available

## Edge Case Handling

- **Restricted Item Escalation**: Orders containing any restricted items automatically require full approval chain
- **Bundle Mixed Restrictions**: If any item in a bundle requires approval, entire bundle follows restricted workflow
- **FM Overrides**: All modifications by Facility Managers require reason codes and create audit entries
- **System-Generated Orders**: Replenishment orders bypass SM/DM approval but require FM review
- **Network Failures**: Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability and retry mechanisms

## Design Direction

The design should feel authoritative and trustworthy like enterprise financial software, emphasizing clarity and efficiency over visual flair, with a minimal interface that prioritizes information density and rapid task completion.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using professional blue and warm orange to create visual hierarchy while maintaining corporate credibility and highlighting critical actions.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Corporate Blue `oklch(0.45 0.15 240)` - Communicates trust, stability, and enterprise reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays `oklch(0.95 0 0)` and `oklch(0.15 0 0)` for backgrounds and structure
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange `oklch(0.65 0.18 45)` - Draws attention to primary actions and critical notifications
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White `oklch(1 0 0)`): Dark Gray text `oklch(0.15 0 0)` - Ratio 15.0:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue `oklch(0.45 0.15 240)`): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 8.5:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange `oklch(0.65 0.18 45)`): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray `oklch(0.98 0 0)`): Dark Gray text `oklch(0.15 0 0)` - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and readability appropriate for data-heavy enterprise workflows, using Inter for its excellent legibility at small sizes and professional appearance.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal letter spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal letter spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Labels: Inter Medium/14px/normal letter spacing
  - Captions: Inter Regular/12px/loose letter spacing

## Animations

Subtle and purposeful animations that communicate state changes and guide user attention without creating unnecessary delays or visual noise.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the approval workflow progression and provides immediate feedback for critical actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Order status changes and approval actions receive priority animation treatment, while secondary interactions use minimal motion

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card for order summaries, Table for order lists, Badge for status indicators, Button variants for approval actions, Dialog for order details, Form for submissions, Select for filtering
- **Customizations**: Status badge component with role-specific colors, approval action buttons with loading states, order timeline component for tracking
- **States**: Approval buttons show loading, success, and error states with appropriate colors and icons
- **Icon Selection**: CheckCircle for approvals, XCircle for rejections, Clock for pending, Package for shipping, Eye for viewing
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4/8/16/24px spacing scale using Tailwind's spacing utilities
